Please, read a bit:

Here are 2 files: T-Emulator's Python code called temulator_textedit.py & and little file which provides you an opportunity to get .exe file of this T-Emulator
The further instructions are out of need, i suppose, however i will notice, that this T-Emulator in fact is just a toy (there are about 10000 steps limit).
Moreover, the instructions are pretty rough. imao.
